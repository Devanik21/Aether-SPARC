- Aligned theoretical compute-reduction estimates with constraints imposed by neuromorphic scheduling mechanisms.
- Analyzed edge cases where bursty inputs may violate assumed sparsity patterns and require fallback execution paths.
- Reviewed assumptions used in Loihi-class energy projections under asynchronous execution semantics.
- Reframed intermediate observations as hypotheses suitable for controlled empirical validation.
- Test: verifying GitHub Actions identity.
- Test: verifying commit loop integrity.
- Test: validating per-commit execution semantics.
- Test: confirming no code paths are touched.
- Test: confirming no code paths are touched.
- Recorded open questions regarding scaling behavior under increased temporal resolution and sensor bandwidth.
