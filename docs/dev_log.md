- Aligned theoretical compute-reduction estimates with constraints imposed by neuromorphic scheduling mechanisms.
- Analyzed edge cases where bursty inputs may violate assumed sparsity patterns and require fallback execution paths.
- Reviewed assumptions used in Loihi-class energy projections under asynchronous execution semantics.
- Reframed intermediate observations as hypotheses suitable for controlled empirical validation.
